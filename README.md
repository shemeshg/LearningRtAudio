# Learning RtAudio

Myself Learning RtAudio with the excellent Bela.io tutorial

https://learn.bela.io/tutorials/c-plus-plus-for-real-time-audio-programming/real-time/

For now developing on local computer until having the actual Bela device...

Also found this tutorial that I might learn more after Bela IO

https://people.carleton.edu/~jellinge/cs312_w2020/week7_3.html

I use these resources for personal learning, nothing proffesional.
